Starcoin held the first phase of the Proxima test network mining event a few months ago, which lasted for a fortnight and attracted many users, including veteran miners who have been working in the industry for years and have detected the future value properties of Starcoin with their rapid radar, as well as newcomers to the mining community who were attracted by the innovative 'one-click mining with zero threshold'. 

The mining event allowed everyone to experience the Starcoin test network's mining mechanism first-hand, and gave the technical team valuable data feedback to help us continuously optimise the project. Thank you again for your participation and help!

After recent optimisations and upgrades, we are now launching the second phase of the Starcoin Barnard test network mining campaign! The Barnard network will generate Genesis blocks based on the Proxima network with a height of 956,666 blocks, and users worldwide will be able to launch the network together.

This is the final round of beta mining before the Starcoin mainnet goes live, which will also be based on the Barnard network. Double the prize pool, double the time and double the prizes! We will also be giving away a number of Starcoin miners to be mined at the same time as the launch of the main network, so you can be the first to get your hands on Starcoin mainnet coins.
