Dear Community Users,

We can’t wait to share this joy with you on this day of celebration! Because it’s the first anniversary of the Starcoin mainnet launch! Thank you for your continued attention. It’s been a challenging but wonderful year despite the turbulent market. Starcoin team is always full of enthusiasm, insisting on building more user-oriented application scenarios to ensure the security of user assets, make steady progress, and explore the most essential and core value of the decentralized Web 3.0. We sincerely invite you to look back at what we have achieved at every step.

Starcoin is a proof-of-work blockchain that enables secure smart contracts to power services in decentralized finance, gaming, and NFTs. In design, Starcoin incorporates the concept of security and introduces Move as a smart contract language to define safer user assets in the form of resources. In terms of implementation, Starcoin improves the scalability of applications and the interoperability of users through a layered architecture.

During the past year, Starcoin has built a scalable solution on Web3 infrastructure to serve users with the concept of security as a fundamental layer.

Here are the highlights for Starcoin over the past year.

The Starcoin community is flourishing as the number of people grows; with tens of thousands of users following us, our various projects are getting much support from the community! We sincerely thank all of you involved in the Starcoin ecosystem on this memorable day.

**Developers**

As we all know, developers have driven the project’s main features forward, and 37 contributors have made 3457 commits on the main chain GitHub master code and completed 83 releases so far. Thanks to the developers’ contributions, Starcoin has achieved day-to-day development in terms of performance, stability, security, and scalability, and the supported network has been running safely and stably for one year.

Since the launch of the Starcoin mainnet, the application ecosystem has grown by leaps and bounds. With the support of community developers, Starcoin successfully organized 4 developer events, including 2 Starcoin & Move online Hackathon conferences and several rounds of security bounty events. Meanwhile, the Hackathon has led to the landing of many great DeFi projects, contributing to an extraordinary experience for Starcoin users.

**Content Creators**

Content creators are all those who contribute to the dissemination and understanding of Starcoin on social media channels. Thanks to the hundreds of long articles and videos posted by content creators on different channels over the past year, they have contributed essential additions to the official documentation.

Some of the content creators translated Starcoin-related content into different languages, which effectively promoted the awareness of Starcoin in other countries and expanded the user base.

In addition, some creators have shared and answered topics of interest to users through Live, AMA, Community Call, and other online community events, which effectively increased the knowledge of the community about the project and indirectly promoted the optimization and improvement of the project.

**Miners and Node Validators**

Starcoin is a P2P blockchain network. Miners and validators are the shields who secure the network.

The Starcoin network currently has hundreds of nodes, with a total network hash rate of around 80 MH/s. Special thanks to the miners and validators who participated in the test network mining events before the mainnet launch. They are genuinely early Starcoin adopters.

The trust from the miners commits time and computing power to the network. Moreover, they guarded the network’s security, which guaranteed the long-term stable operation of Starcoin and the safety of user assets.

It is a celebration that the Starcoin mainnet has been running stably for one year without any network security breaches or double-spend problems because of their contributions!

Starcoin is an optimized Nakamoto Consensus PoW network, thanks to the grand design of Satoshi Nakamoto.

**Community Users and DAO**

Community contributors include users who have helped evangelize or provided recommendations in different community channels over the years. Thanks to the trust and persistence of users, Starcoin has gradually grown more robust.

Having a leading public chain supporting on-chain DAO governance, Starcoin has completed 12 system upgrades with the participation of community users, including significant features such as Oracle, NFT specification, etc. The DAO governance has enabled Starcoin better to meet the requirements of users and the industry and enhance the value of the users of Starcoin.

With the support of community users, the Starcoin ecosystem has also made significant progress in its ecosystem, including several essential tracks such as DEX, NFT, Stablecoin, and Bridge.

The Startcoin Grant program is also devoted to rewarding community users in different dimensions. It has already got a handful of contributors, and we will continue to increase the coverage of this program next.

Thanks to all team members for all their efforts.

With the gradual deepening of the exploration of decentralization, the team and the community will continue innovating and improving scalable solutions based on the guarantee of asset security to be a convenient and efficient Web 3.0 infrastructure application for users. It will continue to develop over a more extended period and create more excellent value with community users who participate in the ecological construction!
