Dear community members,

In October, we embarked on the journey of Starcoin 2.0, offering a sneak peek at the TurboSTM preview version of Starcoin 2.0. **Now, we sincerely invite you to join the inaugural FlexiDAG experience event, partake in our exclusive early access, and personally witness the transformative power of FlexiDAG. Don’t miss the opportunity to be at the forefront of blockchain innovation!**

FlexiDAG represents Starcoin’s latest endeavor to enhance performance and security. It combines the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure with Satoshi Nakamoto’s enhanced proof-of-work consensus, ushering in a revolution for Starcoin. By introducing FlexiDAG, we have effectively increased system throughput and efficiency, providing robust performance support for a variety of use cases. Let’s delve deeper into this exciting technology!

FlexiDAG employs the DAG mechanism to handle block generation, successfully tackling the challenge of parallel block generation, allowing multiple blocks to be generated and added to the blockchain simultaneously. This technological innovation significantly boosts transactions per second (tps), reduces transaction latency, and enhances transaction response times, particularly suitable for high transaction volumes and rapid confirmation requirements.

Another significant improvement is the new consensus protocol that eliminates the previous uncle block mechanism. Unsuccessfully competing blocks are no longer discarded; they have the opportunity to become valid blocks incorporated into the blockchain. This enhancement effectively increases mining power utilization, reduces waste, and improves the overall efficiency of the entire blockchain system.

Furthermore, FlexiDAG exhibits adaptability, dynamically adjusting block generation times and other consensus parameters based on network congestion, ensuring network stability and performance during high loads. This adaptability allows FlexiDAG to optimize according to real network conditions, better adapting to ever-changing environments.

**The performance of Starcoin 2.0 is set to undergo a significant boost, with transaction speeds reaching unprecedented heights. We cordially invite you to be among the first to experience the FlexiDAG preview version and share your valuable feedback. Your suggestions not only have the chance to win rewards but also contribute to shaping the future of blockchain technology. Don’t miss the opportunity to participate in the blockchain revolution; explore FlexiDAG today!**
