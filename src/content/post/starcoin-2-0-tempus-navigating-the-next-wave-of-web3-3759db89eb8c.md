> ## **The Changing Times**
>
> In the ever-evolving world of blockchain, we’ve entered a groundbreaking phase to achieve substantial performance improvements: Starcoin 2.0, known as “Tempus”.
>
> “Tempus”, derived from Latin, translates to “time”. It embodies Starcoin’s unwavering commitment to continuous innovation in the blockchain arena, symbolizing our dedication to the rhythm of time, evolution, and persistent progress.
>
> As time marches on, blockchain technology matures, solidifying its position as a pioneering force in revolutionary advancements.
>
> The rapid evolution of this technology is both exhilarating and fraught with challenges that need to be addressed to continue propelling the blockchain industry forward.
>
> ## **What is Starcoin?**
>
> Starcoin is a blockchain project utilizing an improved version of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and the Move programming language for its smart contracts.
>
> Our mission is to provide a secure, high-performance, and inclusive public chain capable of catering to the massive demands of the future without compromising user asset security. We are deeply committed to constructing robust blockchain infrastructure, adhering to principles of security and decentralization, to deliver reliable and future-oriented blockchain solutions that propel the growth of the digital economy.
>
> Starcoin envisions crafting a secure and decentralized digital ecosystem that offers unprecedented opportunities for both individuals and businesses, shaping the future of Web3 infrastructure.
>
> ## **Starcoin’s Trajectory**
>
> Since its initial launch, Starcoin has seen over two years of growth, with profound gratitude owed to the enduring support from our community. As we face industry challenges, our focus remains on enhancing performance, and our ecosystem continues to garner increased backing.
>
> Central to Starcoin’s pledge is maximizing performance while ensuring user asset security. We’re perpetually refining our PoW model, unlocking the potential of the Move smart contract language, and crafting genuinely decentralized, efficient infrastructure.
>
> In the past year, total transactions exceeded 15 million, social media engagement surged by 308%, partnerships strengthened, and our community consistently grew. These figures underscore the vibrant growth of the Starcoin community.
>
> From a technical and ecosystem standpoint, Starcoin prioritizes scalability, security, and governance. With Move version upgrades, transparent management, cross-chain bridge integrations, and the development of Easy Gas, we’re holistically enhancing our infrastructure.
>
> ## **Web3 Industry Today**
>
> The blockchain sector grapples with challenges of scalability, speed, and security — often termed the ‘trilogy’ of blockchain dilemmas. Transaction speed, in particular, is pivotal, especially when forecasting large-scale future transaction demands; the current TPS (transactions per second) seems to fall short.
>
> TPS, gauging the number of transactions a blockchain network can process per second, is crucial for scalability, rapid transaction execution, enhanced user experience, and competitive edge. In an era characterized by swift information dissemination and accelerated development, speedy transaction processing is paramount for user satisfaction, ensuring they’re not hindered by congestion issues.
>
> While Solana is lauded for its impressive throughput, it has made certain trade-offs in decentralization. Concurrently, Ethereum’s Layer 1 performance constraints necessitate Layer 2 solutions to alleviate mainnet congestion and high transaction fees. Furthermore, the Eth2.0 upgrade introduces a PoS consensus mechanism to augment efficiency and scalability, albeit with potential implications for decentralization.
>
> The industry at large is fervently striving to address blockchain network challenges in scalability, security, and speed to achieve higher TPS, thereby fostering broader blockchain application and heightening efficiency. As a pivotal metric, TPS will determine a blockchain network’s standing and competitiveness in an intensely contested market. Starcoin must consistently address challenges in speed and efficiency to meet user demands and encourage wider adoption.
>
> ## **What Drives Starcoin?**
>
> With the digital realm’s relentless advancement, one truth is evident: blockchain technology is gradually cementing its role as a linchpin in the global financial and technological ecosystems. Throughout this progression, Starcoin remains steadfast in its ambition to serve as a formidable cornerstone of this pillar.
>
> **Security: Crafting an Impenetrable Line of Defense**
>
> From its inception, security has been paramount for Starcoin. We recognize that devoid of security, all functionalities and performance are ephemeral. Thus, we became the first permissionless blockchain adopting the Move language and virtual machine, utilizing the tried-and-true PoW consensus while continuously enhancing and updating our cryptographic algorithms.
>
> **Decentralization: Genuine Power Devolution**
>
> Decentralization isn’t just a core tenet for Starcoin; it’s our foundation. We firmly believe that to realize a genuinely decentralized vision, power and control must revert to users. Hence, besides embracing a truly decentralized PoW consensus, Starcoin has conceptualized a unique DAO governance model, enabling all community members to actively partake in decision-making, ensuring every voice resonates.
>
> By embracing user voting, community proposals, and transparent decision-making processes, Starcoin has offered truly decentralized services to global users. We further encourage developers and users to leverage the Starcoin platform, forging and employing decentralized applications to intensify the ecosystem’s decentralization.
>
> **Performance: Unparalleled Speed and Efficiency**
>
> While Starcoin’s initial design emphasized security and decentralization, we soon realized that to cater to the surging market demands, performance was key. Thus, we gradually integrated a myriad of technical optimizations, such as enhanced Nakamoto consensus, parallelized transaction technology TurboSTM, innovative DAG technology FlexiDAG, and tiered design to augment processing speed and minimize transaction costs.
>
> From its humble beginnings, envisioning the most secure decentralized blockchain, Starcoin has indefatigably pursued security, decentralization, and performance for years. With accumulated years of experience and the current landscape in view, we’ve executed groundbreaking performance enhancements, ushering in the era of Starcoin 2.0.
