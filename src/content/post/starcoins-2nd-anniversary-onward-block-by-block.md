**“Challenges are inevitable, but being in defeat is optional.”**

**Hello, Starfam,**

It’s with great joy that we celebrate the second anniversary of Starcoin’s mainnet launch! We are immensely grateful for your continued support and for being part of this adventurous ride. Today, we want to take a moment to reflect on the past year, share highlights, and express our gratitude to the entire Starcoin community for their unwavering dedication.

**Starcoin’s Core Commitments: User Focus and Asset Security**

The Starcoin team has been unwavering in their commitment to building user-oriented application scenarios and ensuring the security of user assets. Our focus on enhancing the proof-of-work model and exploring the core values of the decentralized Web 3.0 using the Move smart contract language has paved the way for a secure, reliable, and efficient public chain.

**Reflecting on Year Two: Resilience, Participation, and Growth**

Year two has been a testament to our resilience, democratic participation, and continuous growth. Despite the challenges posed by the market, we have remained steadfast in our pursuit of redefining values in a decentralized world. Our strong foundation in decentralized finance, on-chain governance, gaming, NFT marketplaces, and stablecoin launch has set the stage for further advancements.

In the past year, Starcoin has experienced significant growth and milestones. Total transactions have reached an impressive 13,310,825, showcasing the increasing adoption and usage of our blockchain platform. Our Twitter followers have grown by approximately 314%, indicating a surge in interest and support within the community. We have formed over 40 collaborative partnerships, strengthening our ecosystem and fostering innovation. Additionally, our Discord community has seen substantial growth, with an approximate increase of 60%. These data points demonstrate the vibrant growth and engagement within the Starcoin community as we celebrate our second anniversary.

**Scalability, Security, and Ecosystem Development**

We have made significant strides in scalability, security, and ecosystem development on Layer 1. The completion of the Starcoin Move version upgrade from v4 to v6 has provided developers with more capabilities, improving transaction performance and enhancing transaction verification. Our commitment to transparent and inclusive governance has led to the creation of DaoSpace, a research and exploration of a decentralized governance platform for the Move ecosystem, empowering users to participate in governance.

**Infrastructure Development**

Infrastructure development has been a key focus for us. The integration of the first cross-chain bridge between the Move and EVM ecosystems has marked a milestone in interoperability. We have also introduced the Easy Gas solution, allowing users to easily initiate transactions without holding STCs, making Dapp applications more accessible and user-friendly.

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to 2023, we are excited to continue our work on developing FlexiDAG, an innovative solution that will further enhance our scalability and lay the groundwork for the future. Additionally, we are actively developing OMO, a project that provides proofs for Layer 2 transactions, to improve the efficiency and security of our ecosystem.

We are grateful to our growing ecosystem for their support and contributions. Community users, DAO participants, partners, content creators, miners, and node validators have all played a crucial role in our success. Together, we have watered the roots of Starcoin, allowing it to flourish and grow.

**As we move forward, our focus remains on providing advanced services in blockchain scalability solutions and driving technological innovations that offer a cost-effective and reliable decentralized experience.** Our community is at the heart of everything we do, and we are committed to creating tools and systems that set new standards and attract greater value to our ecosystem.

On this special anniversary, we shine brightest together! Greater achievements lie ahead, and we are excited for what the future holds. Thank you for being part of the Starcoin community and for your unwavering support.

Here’s to another year of growth, innovation, and success!

**The Starcoin Team**
