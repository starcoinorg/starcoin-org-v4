Starcoin is a permissionless blockchain using Move, a smart contract language explicitly designed for distributed financial applications and digital assets; it is the first public blockchain to support Move contracts. 

Some highlights for the Starcoin Move language:

* Easy to learn
* Flexibility
* An linear logic language that distinguishes between data and resources, making digital assets more secure
* Mathematical method proving the correctness of the system through formal verification

To take full advantage of the Move language, Starcoin activated the Move smart contract publishing feature and launched the first Starcoin Move online hackathon.

## I. Starcoin activated Move smart contract publishing on chain

Starcoin launched a new proposal to officially activate the Move publish permission on June 23, 2021, advocating a full publishing functionality and allowing anyone to deploy Move contracts to the chain. The proposal fully follows the Starcoin on-chain governance process, voting starting on June 23, 2021, and ending on June 30, 2021, after seven days of community voting. With the community's efforts, the proposal was finally voted in with 7357180.4992 STC votes in favor and 1 STC vote against ([proposal and voting details](https://poll.starcoin.org/polls/detail/1)).
