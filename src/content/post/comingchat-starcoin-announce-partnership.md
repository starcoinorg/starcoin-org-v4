We are proud to announce the establishment of our friendly partnership with Starcoin. We applied for Starcoin’s grant, which we plan to use to integrate the Starcoin network within a month, providing STC holders with a safe and secure crypto wallet on mobile.

We will also actively look for further cooperation!
