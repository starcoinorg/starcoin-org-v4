**Starcoin is taking an important step forward in its commitment to decentralized governance with** [***the 2023 Starcoin DAO on-chain governance vote, and will enable the Starcoin Move version upgrade to v6, which will provide more capabilities for developers\*.**](https://twitter.com/StarcoinSTC/status/1628273434794016768) To help user better understand why Starcoin is actively practicing decentralized governance, we share the second post outlining the benefits of Starcoin DAO-based on-chain governance.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have become an increasingly popular way of managing and operating organizations using blockchain technology.Starcoin is a pioneer in exploring the potential of DAOs based on the advantages of the Move smart contract.

**Starcoin, the only blockchain based on enhanced PoW consensus in the Move ecosystem,Which has developed a unique on-chain governance technology for DAOs that offers many benefits over traditional governance models.** In this blog post, we will explore how Starcoin’s on-chain governance technology works and its benefits for DAOs.

## Token-Based Voting on Starcoin

One of the key features of Starcoin’s on-chain governance technology is token-based voting. In a Starcoin DAO, members can vote on proposals using tokens, which represent their stake in the organization. Token-based voting ensures that decisions are made based on the interests of the members who have invested the most in the organization.

## **Direct Democracy and DAO on Starcoin**

Starcoin’s on-chain governance technology provides direct democracy, giving users a direct say in proposals and decisions, thus promoting a decentralized autonomous organization. As a blockchain network, Starcoin ensures decisions are efficient, secure, and resilient. It empowers users to vote on proposals through a decentralized autonomous organization, thus creating a self-governing ecosystem that is not controlled by any central authority.

## Benefits of Starcoin’s On-Chain Governance Technology

Starcoin’s on-chain governance technology offers many benefits over traditional governance models. First, it ensures transparency by removing the need for a central authority, which can reduce the risk of corruption and fraud. Second, it offers security as Starcoin DAOs operate on a blockchain, which provides a tamper-proof record of all transactions. Finally, it offers efficiency by enabling quick decision-making without the need for lengthy bureaucratic processes.

## Conclusion

Starcoin’s on-chain governance technology is a unique and innovative way of managing and operating DAOs. By using blockchain technology and decentralized decision-making, Starcoin’s on-chain governance technology provides transparency, security, and efficiency. If you’re interested in exploring this emerging field, Starcoin’s on-chain governance technology is a great place to start.
