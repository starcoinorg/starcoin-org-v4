Starcoin released v1.0.0-rc, the mainnet will be launched at the height of 310000 in the Barnard network, and the global users can launch Starcoin mainnet together.

When the Barnard network reaches 310000 height, the mainnet node will wait for 6 blocks to be confirmed and then generate the genesis block with the block hash of the 310000 block of the Barnard network as the parent hash of the mainnet genesis block.

After the main network is launched, the core dev team will publish the Genesis block hash first, hardcode the Genesis block into the starcoin node and release Starcoin v1.0 version.
