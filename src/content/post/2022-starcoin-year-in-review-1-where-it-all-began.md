With Christmas just around the corner, we are happy to present the 2022 Starcoin Year in Review.

It is a time for us to look back at you — the **Starcoin community.**

In celebration of this creative community, we are eager to hear from “you and Starcoin.” We collected stories from the community to immerse ourselves in them, and to understand why we connect back where it all began.
