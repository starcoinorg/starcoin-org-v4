Westar launches first permissionless public chain, Starcoin

The Westar team, the pioneer of blockchain infrastructure, has announced that
Starcoin, the world's first finished public chain developed using Move
language, was officially launched.

HONG KONG, Sept 22, 2021 - (ACN Newswire) - The Westar team, the pioneer of
blockchain infrastructure, announces that Starcoin, the world's first
finished public chain developed using Move language, was officially launched.

Move language is a smart contract language developed by Facebook specifically
for Libra. Its primary goal is to manage the state of digital assets. It will
also play an essential part in the Metaverse development and a tremendous
creative experiment in the realm of blockchain. Even though the developers
could envision the future of the Move language, they couldn't imagine it
at the time. Starcoin pioneered the first permissionless public chain to
support Move in less than two years, ushering in a new era. Style evolution.

A thorough analysis of the Move language and its smart contracts by the
Starcoin team has led them to believe it will be a key component of the future
blockchain ecosystem. Digital assets are first-class citizens in Move's
design. When utilized as variables in smart contracts, digital assets may also
be used as parameters, return values, and other inputs. While compiling, the
security check for the compiler is made easier by the language's static
type. As a result, the smart contract's security may be enhanced by
checking "resources" for errors before release. It's not only
that the Move language is naturally compatible with digital asset security,
but it may also act as a firewall against assaults on the public chain. This
puts the Starcoin created on the Move language at the forefront of security
and performance.

The Westar team said that in addition to innovation, creating the necessary
conditions for developers is a must. At present, Starcoin has established a
simple financial infrastructure to serve ordinary users, so that everyone can
participate in the deployment contract, create digital assets, develop DeFi
applications and so on. This financial infrastructure realizes an open
permissionless public chain and has been developed and used for developers. In
the first online Starcoin Move Hackathon Competition which closed recently,
Starcoin attracted more than 30 project teams from around the world to build
DApps based on the Move contract in Starcoin chain. In addition, Starcoin
launched the first Move developer community, which attracted more developers
to feel the charm of Move language to build a Starcoin ecosystem. It is said
that Starcoin's new Move Hackathon Competition is being prepared. All
high-quality technical teams will be supported by STC tokens of Starcoin
foundation.

As a safe and smart contract operation platform with financial system genes,
Starcoin has been able to embody all the market imagination for a
decentralized world. Whether Starcoin tries NFT or Swap it will be implemented
soon, and these have brought more possibilities and hopes to the industry.
Although Starcoin is still very young, DApp led by Move smart contract will be
an important development direction in the future. The prosperity of public
chains is becoming a reality. Starcoin will leave an indelible record in the
history of blockchain development.
