Starcoin is delighted to announce its Ambassador program “Star Dome” 2.0 is launched!

We’re grateful to have received about two hundred ambassador applications from all over the world after the first release of the Star Dome program, which encouraged us to just start the program.

To further activate the growth potential of the community. We are looking to seek passionate and enthusiastic influencers and self-starter community leaders who are passionate about Web3. Meanwhile, in an attempt to maximize the value and achievement of our ambassadors, we have launched StarDome 2.0 to motivate and reward them.

**What’s new in Star Dome 2.0?**

Star Dome 2.0 will be upgraded from [Star Dome 1.0](https://starcoin.medium.com/join-the-starcoin-ambassador-program-star-dome-program-12f1ea41aa1a) and will focus on training ambassadors to become self-made community managers and influence more Starcoin supporters. Star Dome 2.0 aims to proactively customize tasks, enable high-level ambassadors to lead other candidates, be more informative and, on top of completing tasks, be able to spontaneously innovate, or provide valuable input.

- Ambassadors unlock identity promotion from Candidates, Mods, and Junior Ambassadors to Senior Ambassadors by completing six tasks and enjoy Ambassador medal NFTs, token rewards, and team support that match their status.
