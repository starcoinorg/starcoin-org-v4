> TurboSTM is an innovative technology developed by Starcoin, marking the commencement of the STARCOIN 2.0 phase, aimed at enhancing the execution of smart contracts on its mainnet. By introducing parallel processing, it overcomes the limitations of traditional single-threaded execution, enabling the simultaneous execution of multiple smart contracts and transactions. This advancement significantly boosts the throughput and efficiency of the entire blockchain system, especially in high-concurrency scenarios.
>
> The development of TurboSTM was initiated to tackle the bottlenecks presented by the conventional single-threaded execution of smart contracts. With the increase in complex transactions and heightened user demands, traditional methods have become insufficient. TurboSTM employs industry-standard parallelization technology and introduces innovative features like Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) and optimistic locking. These capabilities allow for the concurrent reading and updating of data records, reducing transaction execution time and enhancing overall system performance.
>
> The strengths of TurboSTM lie in its ability to lower transaction costs, increase processing capacity, and offer efficient and secure solutions for various blockchain applications, including DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain-based gaming. Upon the implementation of TurboSTM, STARCOIN 2.0 will undergo a significant performance boost, characterized by higher throughput, lower transaction latency, and enhanced security. This technology aligns with Starcoin’s vision to build a more robust blockchain ecosystem, deliver comprehensive solutions for blockchain applications, and foster digital economic growth. TurboSTM represents a crucial step towards achieving these objectives, furthering the mission to make blockchain technology more accessible and valuable.
>
> TurboSTM epitomizes a part of Starcoin’s continuous evolution, designed to meet the growing demands of users. The traditional methods of executing smart contracts are no longer sufficient to handle complex transactions and high-concurrency environments, making the emergence of TurboSTM vital.
>
> With the launch of TurboSTM, STARCOIN 2.0 will experience substantial performance enhancements, including increased throughput, reduced transaction delays, and bolstered security. **To further engage community members in the development of Starcoin, we invite you to be among the first to experience the TurboSTM preview on the Barnard network and share your valuable feedback.
