    subtitle: Innovative Upgrade 2.0. Elevating Your Experience. 
    desc: >
      Starcoin, launched in 2020, pioneers the integration of Satoshi Nakamoto's enhanced Proof of Work (PoW) consensus with the secure Move programming language for smart contracts. With the introduction of FlexiDAG and TurboSTM upgrades by 2023, Starcoin 2.0, or "Tempus," marks a significant performance boost. This upgrade underscores Starcoin's commitment to continuous innovation, shaping a secure, efficient, and agile decentralized system for Web3 digital life. Through industry-leading parallelization technology like TurboSTM and Directed Acyclic Graph consensus algorithm FlexiDAG, Starcoin enhances scalability and efficiency, envisioning a decentralized digital ecosystem that empowers users to control assets and transact securely and efficiently.

      row_5:
        - Transaction Throughput
        - Lower, as blocks are processed sequentially, about 1,000 TXs / seconds.
        - Remarkably higher, thanks to the parallel processing of transactions 10 -20x faster.

        - Transaction Parallel Execution
        - No
        - >
          Yes. Transactions are organized into blocks, increasing throughput
          by 10 times through the use of TurboSTM.
