            The Starcoin Foundation is an independent standard-setting body
            responsible for overseeing and advancing the Starcoin platform and
            its flourishing ecosystem. As the guardian of the Starcoin protocol
            and brand, the Foundation's role extends beyond supervision. It is
            the driving force behind the adoption and collaboration strategies
            that elevate Starcoin to a global focus. The Foundation's work aims
            to expand the Starcoin community, influence legislative and
            commercial standards, and uphold stakeholder responsibilities at all
            levels.
